Single Responsibility Principle
    It is a variation of the widely used concept of COHESION.
    The idea is simple. If each class has a single responsibility, it will be easier to maintain

    Cohesion -> Degree to which the elements inside a module belong together

    A class should gave only one reason to change.

    A case that violates this pricinplen would be a method that contains business logic with presentation logic.
