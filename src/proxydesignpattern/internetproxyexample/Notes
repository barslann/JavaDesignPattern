Benefits:
    One of the advantages of Proxy pattern is security.
    This pattern avoids duplication of objects which might be huge size and memory intensive. This in turn increases the performance of the application.
    The remote proxy also ensures about security by installing the local code proxy (stub) in the client machine and then accessing the server with help of the remote code.
